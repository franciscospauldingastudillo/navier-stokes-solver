# navier-stokes-solver
Python solver of the Navier Stokes equations for incompressible lid-driven flow in a rectangular domain

See Final-Report.pdf for a detailed description of the physical equations, numerical discretization, and verification and validation of each model function. I also benchmark the results against Ghia et al.
